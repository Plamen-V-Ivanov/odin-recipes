<h2>Description</h2>
<p>I learned this from my Bulgarian mother in law though it's probably Turkish in origin. The recipe calls for 'chubritsa', a Bulgarian herb that can be difficult to find in the states, so basil can be substituted in its place.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li> 5 tablespoons olive oil </li>
    <li> 1 pound ground beef </li>
    <li> 1 teaspoon ground paprika </li>
    <li> 1 teaspoon ground cumin </li>
    <li> 1 teaspoon salt </li>
    <li> 1 teaspoon ground black pepper </li>
    <li> 4 potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes </li>

</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li> Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).  </li>
    <li> Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook ground beef until evenly brown. Season with paprika, cumin, salt, and pepper. Stir in potatoes, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in tomato sauce, and summer savory. Add enough water to just barely cover. Reduce heat, and simmer 15 minutes.  </li>

    <li> Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until top is golden brown.  </li>
</ol>
